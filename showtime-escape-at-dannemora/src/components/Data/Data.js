			'In the dark of night on June 5, 2015, convicted murderers David Sweat and Richard Matt clambered out of a manhole and dashed to freedom on a quiet street near Clinton Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Dannemora, N.Y.',
			'For the three weeks that followed, America remained captivated by the manhunt and unfolding of the Kafkaesque plot, which included a love triangle and a jailhouse art ring. Yet the news coverage revealed only a sliver of a story that was more elaborate and bizarre than anyone imagined.',
			'On Nov. 18, the SHOWTIME Limited Event Series “Escape at Dannemora” will take viewers inside the stranger-than-fiction escape, detailing for the first time how the convicts spent years exploiting prison employees. Many were residents of Dannemora, a town of just a few thousand nestled in the Adirondacks, where the line between freedom and confinement blurred.',
			'<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/11/nyregion/dannemora-new-york-and-its-ties-with-clinton-prison.html">The New York Times wrote five days after the escape: “The prison provides jobs; the community provides labor. And that intertwining of work and life has created a tighter-than-normal bond.” </a>',
			'These six events demonstrate how Sweat and Matt pitted Dannemora against itself and set in motion one of the nation’s most infamous prison breaks. '

				'Indeed, legislators voted in 1844 to build Clinton so inmates could mine iron in the hills nearby. They named the geographically isolated site Dannemora, after a Swedish iron-mining town. Guards had limited options for getting to the jail quickly, in case of emergency, so many moved nearby and formed the village Dannemora.',
				'The remote Clinton facility acquired the nickname “Little Siberia” and would grow to become New York’s largest prison. It “dominated local politics, the economy, the lives and attitudes of the people,” The Times wrote in 1988.',
				'Traffic on Dannemora’s streets and visitors to its few stores and eateries ebb and flow with changing shifts at Clinton, which housed 2,653 inmates and employed 1,283 staff members at the time of the escape.',
				'Life at Clinton can be generational on both sides of its bars. Multiple members of local families have worked there since its inception, and it’s not uncommon for guards to monitor the sons of former inmates.',

Others burrowed into its sewer system or chipped away at cellar walls.  ',
				'Luis Garrastegue, who served time in Clinton in the ’80s and ’90s, told The Times that he and other inmates discussed escape “all the time.” Yet more than a century went by after a prison break in 1912 before any other prisoner would prevail.'
