    text2: 'Innovation is increasing supplies of natural gas —  and helping to cut emissions in the process. ',
    text3: 'The United States is in the midst of unprecedented transformation. A sudden abundance of energy resources — particularly natural gas, as well as oil and renewables — has fundamentally changed our outlook for growth, jobs and the environment. ',
    text4: 'Natural gas sits at the center of this revolution. Surging supplies translate into lower prices for the many goods and services of which natural gas is a part, including fuel, fertilizer, electricity, raw materials and more. ',
    text5: 'This affordability, in turn, has both stimulated economic growth and helped achieve unprecedented reductions in U.S. energy-related carbon emissions. Natural gas has been the main cause for a 14% reduction in our emissions since 2005<sup>1</sup> — more than any other country in the world.<sup>2</sup> As a result, U.S. emissions have fallen to the lowest level in a quarter century.<sup>3</sup> ',
    text6: 'Finding ways to sustain growth while lowering emissions is a growing imperative. By 2040, we’ll have to feed, house and fuel another 1.6 billion people. In emerging regions from Asia to Africa and from the Mideast to South America, development is turbocharging urbanization.<sup>4</sup>',
    text7: 'All told, over the next two decades, worldwide energy demand will grow by nearly a third — comparable to adding another China and India to today’s energy markets.<sup>5</sup> No single source of energy will be able to satisfy all that additional need. Still, the influx of natural gas will play a critical role by helping to meet increasing demand and, indirectly, by enabling the growing use of renewables.',
    text8: ' <span>The U.S. economy has roughly tripled</span> since the late 1970s.<sup>8</sup> And recently, a lot of that growth has been fueled — quite literally — by increasing supplies of natural gas. Taking into account all the ways it touches our lives — creating jobs, generating electricity, heating our homes and manufacturing a wide variety of things — natural gas contributes some $550 billion to our economy every year.<sup>9</sup>'

    text1: 'Innovation Unlocks Untapped Energy ',
    text2: '<span>The resurgence of natural gas</span> dates to the early 2000s. A convergence of technologies — software advances,<sup>11</sup> horizontal drilling and more effective extraction techniques, such as hydraulic fracturing<sup>12</sup> — unlocked vast, previously untappable reserves. U.S. production of natural gas has dramatically risen since, hitting a record in 2017.<sup>13</sup> In turn, ample supply has reduced natural gas prices to historic lows.<sup>14</sup>',
    text3: '<span>More Jobs,</span> <span>More Savings</span>',
    text4: '<span>For the U.S., natural gas has provided </span> a powerful economic lift. By 2040, U.S. households are on track to save an aggregate $100 billion — roughly $655 per household per year — thanks to the rising use of natural gas.<sup>16</sup> The natural gas and oil industry supports 10.3 million U.S. jobs today, as well as jobs in allied industries like electricity, steel production and transportation. That’s half a million more jobs than in 2011.<sup>17</sup>',
    text5: 'Manufacturing<br> Benefits',
    text6: '<span>Manufacturing benefits, too.</span> Cheaper natural gas and electricity has reduced costs for domestic makers of steel, feedstocks, plastics and other industrial goods, making them more competitive internationally.<sup>20</sup> By comparison, natural gas in Europe and Asia has been up to three times more costly than in North America over the past five years. <sup>21</sup>'

    text1: 'Falling<br/> Emissions ',
    text2: '<span>Natural gas is driving a historic shift</span> in how we make electricity.<sup>23</sup> What’s more, it’s also enabling renewables, filling in when wind or solar power ebb. Together, these trends are helping to dramatically reduce U.S. carbon emissions, which shrank by 14% between 2005 and 2017<sup>24</sup> — more than any other country.<sup>25</sup> Natural gas has been the largest contributor to this reduction and, as a result, U.S. emissions have fallen to early 1990s levels.<sup>26</sup> In that period, our carbon intensity — the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> we emit to create every dollar of GDP — has fallen even faster.<sup>27</sup>',
    text3: 'Enabling<br/> Renewables',
    text4: '<span>Indeed, solar, wind and other renewables, </span>which remain our smallest source of electricity overall, are growing rapidly, thanks, in part, to a boost from natural gas.<sup>30</sup> For utilities and consumers alike, the cleaner burning fuel helps solve a problem facing renewables: variable output. Gas-fired generators can be spun up quickly to match ebbing power flows from wind parks when the air goes still or from rooftop solar panels when the sun goes down, or clouds block its rays.<sup>31</sup>',
    text5: '<span>Doing More</span> <span>With Less</span>',
    text6: '<span>Since the late 1970s,</span> the amount of energy needed to run our country — whether to fuel our cars, heat our homes or run our factories — has grown by 25%.<sup>33</sup> That’s a big increase, yet national output has tripled in the same period. Put another way: The entire U.S. economy has become far more efficient.<sup>34</sup>'

    text1: '<span>U.S. Leads</span> <span>in Natural Gas</span>',
    text2: '<span>The resurgence of natural gas </span>is one piece of a larger transformation of the U.S. energy outlook. Complemented by improving efficiency, the related rise of oil output and growth in renewable sources, our overall energy supply is increasingly diversified and balanced. As the world’s top natural gas producer, the U.S. is less vulnerable to supply disruptions, whether from weather disasters, military risks or trade conflicts.<sup>36</sup>',
    text3: '<span>Increasing</span> <span>Exports</span>',
    text4: '<span>With the demand for global energy</span> on the rise, U.S. exports of both natural gas and goods made from it, such as plastics and fertilizers, are surging. For key allies around the world, this has helped lower dependency on incumbent sources, thereby lowering the risk of market- or policy-related supply disruptions.<sup>38</sup>',
    text5: '<span>Growing</span> <span>Global Demand</span>',
    text6: '<span>By 2040, developing nations</span> — home to billions of people — are expected to drive up worldwide energy demand by 30%.<sup>41</sup> Though U.S. carbon emissions shrank last year, they have continued to grow worldwide.<sup>42</sup> In coming decades, as new cities, factories and infrastructures rise around the world, U.S. natural gas can help fuel our energy demand and drive economic growth, both at home and abroad.
